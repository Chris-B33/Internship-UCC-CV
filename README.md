## Description

This is a small game I made as a CV application for a summer internship in UCC. <br>
I decided to make this as Covid was just started, I was becoming interested in JavaScript and had no experience with coding in it previously.

## Installation

It is not required to download this repository to run the application. 
Opening <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Chris-B33/Internship-UCC-CV/blob/master/index.html">this link</a> will bring you to a HTML preview through Github to run it.
<br>
However, if you want to use it offline, download as a zip or clone the repository. You can then open index.html to play.
